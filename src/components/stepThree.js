    With Lizzy&#39;s at your back, head straight forward across the Green and stop on the patch of
grass on the other side of the path.<br /> This will be the site for the Mary Wollstonecraft memorial

You are now walking through the site of <b>Wollstonecraft Live!</b> by Kaethe Fine, conceived by
Anna Birch and Kaethe Fine, and directed by Anna Birch performances in September 2005.
These unique multimedia performances began in Unitarian Meeting House and continued
on the Green and were reprised as some of the last performances in the Unitarian Meeting
House in 2018 before it closed for renovation.<br /><br />
In the late summer of 2007 Fragments &amp; Monuments hosted a picnic and outdoor screening
where you are walking of the The Wollstonecraft Live Experience! films on the Green with
live music performed by the famous Deidre Cartwright Trio.<br /><br />
In 2019 local company Scary Little Girls joined forces with Fragments &amp; Monuments to
celebrate Mary and the Living Literature Walks were held here funded, by the Heritage
Lottery and supported by Stoke Newington Literary Festival. At this point in the walk the
audience listened to Wollstonecraftâ€™s words as interpreted by playwright by Kaethe Fine in the
specially composed soundscape by composer Alastair Gavin (you can find this special recording under <Link to={"/media"}>Media</Link> on this app) and were given postcards encouraging them to give
generously to the Mary On the Green memorial fund.
