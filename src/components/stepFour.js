            On Poetry, and Our Relish for the Beauties of Nature

              A taste for rural scenes, in the present state of society, appears
              to be very often an artificial sentiment, rather inspired by
              poetry and romances, than a real perception of the beauties of
              nature. But, as it is reckoned a proof of refined taste to praise
              the calm pleasures which the countryside affords, the theme is
              never exhausted. Yet it may be made a question, whether this
              romantic kind of declamation, has much effect on the conduct of
              those, who leave, for a season, the crowded cities in which they
              were bred.{" "}

              In this more advanced state of civilisation a poet is rather the
              creature of art, than of nature. The books that he reads in his
              youth become a hotbed in which artificial flowers are produced,
              beautiful to the common eye, though they want the true hue and
              favour. His images do not arise from sensations, they are copies.
              The silken wings of fancy are shrivelled by rules; and a desire of
              attaining elegance of diction occasions an attention to words,
              incompatible with sublime, impassioned thoughts.

              But God is seen in every floating cloud, and comes from the misty
              mountains to receive the noblest homage of an intelligent creature
              – praise. How solemn is the moment when all affections and
              remembrances fade before the admiration which the goodness and
              wisdom of God inspires when he is worshiped in a temple not made
              with the hands, and the world seems only to contain the mind that
              formed and the mind that contemplates it! These are not the weak
              responses of ceremonial devotion; nor, to express them, would the
              true poet need another poets aid; his heart burns within him, and
              he speaks the language of truth and nature with resistless energy.

              Boys who have received a classical education load their memory
              with words and the correspondent ideas are perhaps never
              distinctly comprehended. But though it should be allowed that
              books may produce some poets, I fear they will never be the poets
              that charm our cares to sleep, or exhort admiration. They may
              diffuse taste, and polish the language; but I am inclined to
              conclude that they will seldom rouse the passions, or amend the
              heart.
