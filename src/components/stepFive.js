            which she wrote in response to criticism from her lover William
            Godwin about the lack of formality in her style. Very little of this
            work remains because Godwin destroyed this and others of her works
            that didn&#39;t fit his view of what her legacy should be after her
            death. However, when Mary and Godwin&#39;s daughter, Mary, and the
            poet Percy Shelley were falling in love they would obsessively read
            a remaining copy of the essay they have found over Wollstonecraft’s
            grave. The ideas in it inspired the young writers and through them
            became the backbone of the ideology of the Romantic movement,
            another debt we owe to Wollstonecraft&#39;s remarkable vision,
            prowess and resilience.

                When the memory of one&#39;s predecessors is buried, the

                everything for the first time. And if no one ever did it before,

            and 80&#39;s, Mary&#39;s influence in history, politics and
