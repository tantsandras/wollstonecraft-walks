  At our visit to Hackney Archive on Tuesday 6 June 2019 with Wollstonecraft
  Walks volunteers a special selection of books by and about Mary Wollstonecraft
  and Newington Green were laid out on a library trolley for us. We were very
  excited to see an original publication of 'A Vindication of the Rights of
  Woman' (1792) paired with our very own limited edition art book 'The
  Wollstonecraft Live Experience !' by Anna Birch and Taey Iohe (2010).
