  A father and son who were much-loved in Islington and Hackney have died within
  days of each other after reportedly catching Covid-19.


  Ahmet shared his expertise of local history with me and Rebecca Mordan from
  Scary Little Girls for Wollstonecraft Walks 2019.  When I visited the shop, I
  complimented Ahmet on his memorable radio voice and chatted about the
  dissenting her story at Newington Green. From a drawer in the back of the shop
  he bought out the Pat Haynes local history book of Newington Green. I was
  delighted as Pat Haynes book was the first reference to Mary Wollstonecraft
  and her time on Newington Green that I saw back in the 90â€™s when the librarian
  at Newington Green shared this trailblazing publication with me. My children
  attended the Primary School in the late 1990's when their wonderful head
  teacher was Christine Yorston. BTW Ahmet attended Stoke Newington Secondary
  School where my kids also went. We have great local schools!
